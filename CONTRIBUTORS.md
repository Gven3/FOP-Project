# Team message:
While each member had designated areas of responsibility, we actively worked on improving each other's code. We frequently reviewed and optimized implementations, shared constructive feedback, and resolved challenges together. This collaborative process not only strengthened our codebase but also enhanced our individual understanding of components we did not initially develop.

In the end, all members contributed equally to the project. By working together and supporting each other's learning, we ensured the success of the project while fostering a deeper understanding of interpreter design and programming principles across the entire team.
